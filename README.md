## Features

- Fetches playlists from the NoviSign API and displays each item (image or video) in a looping slideshow.

## Architecture

This project follows the **MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel)** architecture, ensuring a clear separation of concerns and making it easier to test and maintain.

- **Model**: Handles data and business logic. In this app, `PlaylistRepository` fetches data from the `NoviSignApi`.
- **ViewModel**: `SlideshowViewModel` provides the data to the UI and manages its state. It also controls the play/pause functionality.
- **View**: Composables in `SlideshowScreen` handle the display and user interaction.

## Libraries Used
